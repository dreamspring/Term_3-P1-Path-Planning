# CarND-Path-Planning-Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program
   

### Goals
In this project your goal is to safely navigate around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving +-10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit. You will be provided the car's localization and sensor fusion data, there is also a sparse map list of waypoints around the highway. The car should try to go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, which means passing slower traffic when possible, note that other cars will try to change lanes too. The car should avoid hitting other cars at all cost as well as driving inside of the marked road lanes at all times, unless going from one lane to another. The car should be able to make one complete loop around the 6946m highway. Since the car is trying to go 50 MPH, it should take a little over 5 minutes to complete 1 loop. Also the car should not experience total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 and jerk that is greater than 10 m/s^3.

#### The map of the highway is in data/highway_map.txt

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./path_planning`.


## Project Rubics:

## Compilation

### The code compiles correctly.

Code compiles without errors with cmake and make.

## Valid trajectories

### The car is able to drive at least 4.32 miles without incident.
I ran the simulator for more than 7 miles without incidents:

![7 miles](images/7miles.png)


### The car drives according to the speed limit.
The speed limit in the code is set to 49.5 mile/hour. The car never drives faster than the limit.

### Max Acceleration and Jerk are not Exceeded.
Yes. The max acceleration and jerk are not exceeded.

### Car does not have collisions.
No collisions occurs during the 7 miles driving.

### The car stays in its lane, except for the time between changing lanes.
The criteria is satisfied. The car doesn't spend more than a 3 second length out side the lane lanes during changing lanes, and every other time the car stays inside one of the 3 lanes on the right hand side of the road.

### The car is able to change lanes
The car is able to smoothly change lanes when it makes sense to do so.

## Reflection

Based on the provided code from the seed project, the path planning algorithms start at [src/main.cpp](./src/main.cpp#L246) line 246 to the line 416. The code could be separated into different functions to show the overall process, but I prefer to have everything in a single place to avoid jumping to different parts of the file or other files. In a more complicated environment and different requirements, more structure could be used. For now, comments are provided to improve the code readability.

The code consist of three parts:

### Prediction [line 255 to line 290](./src/main.cpp#L255)
This part of the code deal with the telemetry and sensor fusion data. It intents to reason about the environment. In the case, we want to know three aspects of it:

- Is there a car in front of us blocking the traffic.
- Is there a car to the right of us making a lane change not safe.
- Is there a car to the left of us making a lane change not safe.

These questions are answered by calculating the lane each other car is and the position it will be at the end of the last plan trajectory. A car is considered "dangerous" when its distance to our car is less than 30 meters in front or behind us.

### Behavior [line 292 to line 314](./scr/main.cpp#L293)
This part decides what to do:
  - If we have a car in front of us, do we change lanes?
  - Do we speed up or slow down?

Based on the prediction of the situation we are in, this code increases the speed, decrease speed, or make a lane change when it is safe. Instead of increasing the speed at this part of the code, a `speed_diff` is created to be used for speed changes when generating the trajectory in the last part of the code. This approach makes the car more responsive acting faster to changing situations like a car in front of it trying to apply breaks to cause a collision.

### Trajectory [line 317 to line 416](./scr/main.cpp#L313)
This code does the calculation of the trajectory based on the speed and lane output from the behavior, car coordinates and past path points.

First, the last two points of the previous trajectory (or the car position if there are no previous trajectory, lines 321 to 345) are used in conjunction three points at a far distance (lines 348 to 350) to initialize the spline calculation (line 370 and 371). To make the work less complicated to the spline calculation based on those points, the coordinates are transformed (shift and rotation) to local car coordinates (lines 361 to 367).

In order to ensure more continuity on the trajectory (in addition to adding the last two point of the pass trajectory to the spline adjustment), the pass trajectory points are copied to the new trajectory (lines 374 to 379). The rest of the points are calculated by evaluating the spline and transforming the output coordinates to not local coordinates (lines 388 to 407). Worth noticing the change in the velocity of the car from line 393 to 398. The speed change is decided on the behavior part of the code, but it is used in that part to increase/decrease speed on every trajectory points instead of doing it for the complete trajectory.
